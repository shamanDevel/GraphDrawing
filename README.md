# GraphDrawing
Project for the pro-seminar "Graph Drawing", implements the optimal crossing minimization (OOCM) algorithm
as described in "A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization" by Markus Chimani, Petra Mutzel, and Immanuel Bomze.
(see the document oocm_preprint.pdf in the root of the repository)

**This project is finished!**
It works and no future effort is spent on it.
See the two documents Presentation.pdf and Work.pdf for the presentation and paper written by me over this project.
